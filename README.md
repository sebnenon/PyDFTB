# PyDFTB

This is a tentative library and toolkit for DFTB+.

This is not intended to be perfect, and the user experience is getting improved.

At the moment, this is the first commit, the code is not totally useable as is (mostly due to french comments, and lacking comments).


**What to do with this?**

This package is intended tu ease the life of DFTB+ users. It is partly based on the python codes developped by Balint Aradi (BCCMS, Bremen, DE) for DOS functionalities.

It contains:

- conversion tools (Gaussian, VASP ...)
- geometry tools
- mathematical treatments (NLO calculations)
- submission tools (generation of inputs)
- ...


More doc will come ASAP.

Have fun, and do not hesitate to criticize ;)
